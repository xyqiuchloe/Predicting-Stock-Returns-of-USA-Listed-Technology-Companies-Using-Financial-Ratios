# Predicting-Stock-Returns-of-USA-Listed-Technology-Companies-Using-Financial-Ratios
Academic Project with R programming

Investment in financial securities, especially stocks, has become an important aspect
of the American economy since the last century. Each day, over 1.5 billion shares of stock are
traded on the New York Stock Exchange with millions of people relying on stock trading as
their main source of income. At the same time, professional investors and researchers have
committed extensive effort to analyze the market in order to gain a competitive advantage
over other investors but have not yet been able to find a way to consistently superior returns.
Almost without exception, researchers before the 1980s concluded that the
efficient-market hypothesis offers a remarkably good capture of the reality of stock markets.
The hypothesis states that all information available to a market is already reflected in stock
price, making it impossible to predict changes in stock price without insider information.
However, since the 1980s, cracks in this hypothesis started to appear that examples of
anomalies seem to indicate that investors could potentially outsmart the market competition
by identifying mispriced stocks following certain rules. Fundamental analysis of financial
ratios are thereafter invented as a comparative tool in evaluating companies’ business
performance to identify those mispriced stocks.
However, the traditional method of fundamental analysis doesn’t systematically relate
financial ratios to stock return. Instead, its performance heavily relies on the experience of
profession stock analytics. This study therefore aims to contribute to the field of stock
investment by achieving two objectives 1) test the efficient market hypothesis and identify
any financial ratios that have significant predictive power on future stock return. 2) build
statistical models that can be used for creating stock investment portfolios that earn abnormal
gains in stock markets if any useful relationship between financial ratios and stock return is
identified.
Specifically, the study employs generalized linear model and random forest methods
to investigate the relationship between 7 financial ratios and stock returns for 54 technology
firms traded in the United States stock markets throughout 2010-2018. Two algorithms are
applied in order to cross-check the reliability of the final results. Besides, to evaluate the
practical value of the identified relationship, this study examines whether winning portfolios
formed based on the identified relationship end up producing excess returns over losing
3
portfolios and S&P 500 index using a hold-out testing set. Higher returns on winning
portfolios would provide evidence for market anomalies that can be taken advantage of for
stock investment and hence challenge efficient market hypothesis.
